Creating fine print on a phone

Hi there, I'm from a small town in Illinois, USA. 
I'm on the path to becomming a software developer. 
I like movies, comedy, architecture, and exercize. 
Currently, I work as a mold Technician, 
which is a fancy way of saying mechanic. 
But, I'm mostly interested in programming the robots
which pick the molded parts. 
For my hello-world idea, I'd like to write a code 
that makes fine print from a screen shot of text 
snapped by the user.
